# Algorithms

This repository contains various algorithm implementations and examples maintained by [@TareqAlKushari](https://github.com/TareqAlKushari).

## Overview

The **Algorithms** repository is designed to serve as a comprehensive resource for learning, practicing, and referencing classic and advanced algorithms. It includes well-documented code samples, explanations, and usage examples, making it suitable for students, interview preparation, and anyone interested in computer science fundamentals.

## Features

- Implementations of a wide range of algorithms (e.g., searching, sorting, graph algorithms, dynamic programming)
- Example problems and solutions
- Code samples in different programming languages
- Readable and well-documented code
- Useful for education, interview prep, and self-study

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A suitable compiler or interpreter for the language(s) used (e.g., Python, C++, Java)
- (Optional) Build tools such as `make`, `cmake`, or language-specific package managers

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TareqAlKushari/Algorithms.git
cd Algorithms
```

### Usage

Each algorithm is typically organized in its own directory or file. Example commands:

#### For Python

```bash
python binary_search.py
```

#### For C++

```bash
g++ quick_sort.cpp -o quick_sort
./quick_sort
```

#### For Java

```bash
javac MergeSort.java
java MergeSort
```

Refer to the README or comments in each subdirectory for more details.

## Folder Structure

Example structure:

```
/searching      - Search algorithms (binary search, linear search, etc.)
/sorting        - Sorting algorithms (quick sort, merge sort, bubble sort, etc.)
/graphs         - Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
/dynamic_prog   - Dynamic programming solutions
/others         - Miscellaneous algorithms
```
